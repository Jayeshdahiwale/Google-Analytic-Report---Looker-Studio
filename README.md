# Google Analytics Report - Looker Studio


This repository contains my analysis of the Google Merchandise Store using Looker Studio. I explored various aspects of the store's performance and customer behavior through cohort analytics, funnel analytics, and integration with Google Analytics.

In this analysis, I leveraged Looker Studio's powerful visualization and querying capabilities to gain insights into key metrics, identify trends, and understand the customer journey. The cohort analysis helped me understand how different groups of customers behave over time, while the funnel analysis allowed me to track user interactions and identify potential bottlenecks in the conversion process.

By integrating with Google Analytics, I was able to supplement the data from Looker Studio with additional metrics and dimensions, providing a comprehensive view of the Google Merchandise Store's performance.
